## What is MMTOOL 4.50.0.23.7z?
 
MMTOOL 4.50.0.23.7z is a BIOS modding tool developed by American Megatrends Inc (AMI), the company that produces the AMI Aptio UEFI BIOSes for many motherboards.
 
The tool works with AMI Aptio IV BIOSes, which are compatible with Intel 6/7/8/9-Series or X79 chipset mainboards, as well as AMI Aptio V BIOSes, which are compatible with newer Intel chipset mainboards from 100-Series up.
 
The tool can perform various operations on the BIOS modules, such as:
 
- Updating an existing module with a newer version
- Extracting a module from the BIOS and saving it as a file
- Inserting a new module into the BIOS from a file
- Deleting a module from the BIOS
- Replacing a module in the BIOS with another one
- Viewing the information and details of the modules

The tool supports both legacy and EFI modules, which are different types of code that run in different modes of the CPU.
 
Legacy modules are also known as option ROMs, and they run in 16-bit real mode. They are usually used for device drivers, such as RAID controllers, network cards, or video cards.
 
EFI modules are also known as EFI drivers, and they run in 64-bit protected mode. They are usually used for UEFI applications, such as boot managers, shell, or firmware updates.

- **Audiomatic Retro Transformer:** A new rack device that adds vintage character and vibe to any sound. Choose from 16 different presets, such as VHS, Vinyl, Gadget, or HiFi, and tweak the parameters to get the perfect retro sound.
- **External MIDI Instrument:** A new rack device that lets you control any external MIDI device from Reason. You can send MIDI notes, CC messages, and program changes, as well as record the audio output of your external device into Reason.
- **MIDI Out:** A new feature that allows you to send MIDI data from any Reason device to any external MIDI device or software. You can use this to trigger drum machines, synthesizers, or plug-ins from Reason's sequencer or rack devices.
- **Audio Slicing and Quantize:** A new feature that lets you slice any audio clip into individual slices that can be moved, edited, or quantized independently. You can also apply groove templates or ReGroove settings to your audio slices to create rhythmic variations.
- **Audio Transpose:** A new feature that lets you change the pitch of any audio clip without affecting the tempo. You can use this to tune vocals, create harmonies, or modulate sounds.
- **Expanded Factory Sound Bank:** A new collection of sounds and loops that cover a wide range of genres and styles. You can find new patches for Thor, MalstrÃ¶m, Subtractor, Kong, Dr. Octo Rex, and more, as well as new ReFills from Loopmasters and Zero-G.

Reason 7 is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X, and supports VST and AU plug-ins via the Propellerhead Rack Extension format. You can also use Reason 7 as a ReWire slave or master with other DAWs.
